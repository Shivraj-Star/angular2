The sample\r\nrelies on System.js to load TypeScript modules and the required scripts used in the application.\r\n\r\nThe sample is based on Angular 2 Beta 1.\r\n\r\nSimply clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Angular 2 Concepts Covered\r\n\r\n* TypeScript version that relies on classes and modules\r\n* Modules are loaded with System.js\r\n* Defining routes \r\n* Using Custom Components\r\n* Using Custom Directives\r\n* Using Custom Pipes\r\n* Defining Properties and Using Events in Components/Directives\r\n* Using the Http object for Ajax calls.\r\n* Working with Utility and Service classes.\r\n* Using Angular 2 databinding Syntax [], () and [()]\r\n\r\n## Running the Application\r\n\r\n1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies\r\n\r\n1. Run `npm run tsc` to start the TypeScript compiler (it will watch for changes to .ts files)\r\n\r\n1. Run `npm start` in a separate terminal window to start the server and launch the app\r\n\r\nI am working on a new Angular 2 hands-on/instructor-led training course \r\nas well as a video course that will be released in 2016!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
